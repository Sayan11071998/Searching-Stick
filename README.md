# 🚀 Searching Sticks 🎮✨

## Project Milestone

Hey everyone! Super excited to share my latest project: **Searching Sticks**! Built with **C++** and **SFML**, this game combines fun visuals with algorithm learning—a perfect way to make searching algorithms more interactive and enjoyable!

---

## Game Features

- 🔍 **Search & Learn**  
  - The game presents a list of sticks, and your mission is to find a random target stick.

- 👆 **Two Modes**  
  1. **Linear Search Mode**: Search through an unsorted list one stick at a time.  
  2. **Binary Search Mode**: Use the power of the Binary Search Algorithm on a sorted list for faster results!

- 💡 **Visual Learning**  
  - Each step of the algorithm is brought to life with smooth animations, so you can watch and learn as the algorithm works its magic!

## Key Takeaways

- 💡 **Algorithms in Action**  
  - Gained hands-on experience with searching algorithms while solving coding challenges.

- 🧩 **Clean & Modular Code**  
  - Designed using OOP principles for scalability and flexibility.

- 🎨 **Game Dev Creativity**  
  - Enhanced skills in SFML to create smooth visuals, seamless animations, and immersive sound effects.

- 👨‍💻 **Linear Search Insight**  
  - Explored its time and space complexities, understood the best-case scenarios (e.g., when the target is near the beginning), and identified when to use it efficiently.

- ⚡ **Binary Search Optimization**  
  - Mastered the logarithmic time complexity, learned why it’s perfect for sorted data, and understood its significance in making search operations lightning fast!

- 👨‍💻 **Problem-Solving Mastery**  
  - Learned how to integrate algorithms into a game environment in a way that’s both educational and fun!
