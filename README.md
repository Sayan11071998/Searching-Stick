# ***🚀 Project Milestone: Searching Sticks! 🎮✨***

🌟 Hey everyone! Super excited to share my latest project: Searching Sticks! Built with C++ and SFML, this game combines fun visuals with algorithm learning—a perfect way to make searching algorithms more interactive and enjoyable! 🎉

## **🎯 Game Features:**
- ### *🔍 Search & Learn:*
- 🥢 The game presents a list of sticks, and your mission is to find a random target stick.
- ### *👆 Two Modes:*
- 1️⃣ Linear Search Mode: Search through an unsorted list one stick at a time.
- 2️⃣ Binary Search Mode: Use the power of the Binary Search Algorithm on a sorted list for faster results!
- **💡 Visual Learning:** Each step of the algorithm is brought to life with smooth animations, so you can watch and learn as the algorithm works its magic! ✨

## **✨ Key Takeaways:**
- **💡 Algorithms in Action:** Gained hands-on experience with searching algorithms while solving coding challenges.
- **🧩 Clean & Modular Code:** Designed using OOP principles for scalability and flexibility.
- **🎨 Game Dev Creativity:** Enhanced skills in SFML to create smooth visuals, seamless animations, and immersive sound effects.
- **👨‍💻 Linear Search Insight:** Explored its time and space complexities, understood the best-case scenarios (e.g., when the target is near the beginning), and identified when to use it efficiently.
- **⚡ Binary Search Optimization:** Mastered the logarithmic time complexity, learned why it’s perfect for sorted data, and understood its significance in making search operations lightning fast!
- **👨‍💻 Problem-Solving Mastery:** Learned how to integrate algorithms into a game environment in a way that’s both educational and fun!
